# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and customers worldwide. With the increasing volume of digital transactions, traditional fraud detection methods (manual reviews, static rules) often struggle to keep pace.  

This project demonstrates how to use **Azure Machine Learning Studio** to build, train, and deploy a **classification model** that can detect fraudulent transactions in real time.  

The solution leverages **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)** to automatically find the best-performing algorithm, deploys it as a predictive web service, and tests it with sample transactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Azure Machine Learning Studio** (AutoML, Workspace, Datasets, Compute)
- **Azure Blob Storage**
- **Azure Compute Instance / Cluster**
- **JupyterLab**
- **Python (for testing endpoint)**

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- Import and preprocess historical credit card transaction data  
- Use **AutoML** for classification to detect fraud vs. legitimate transactions  
- Deploy the best model as a **real-time endpoint**  
- Test predictions using JupyterLab with REST API calls  
- Ensure scalability with Azure Compute resources  
- Share results on LinkedIn / Community for professional visibility
